# Swap-Number
A simple Java program that swaps the values of two numbers entered by the user using a temporary variable.

This Java program demonstrates how to exchange (swap) the values of two integer variables entered by the user. The user is prompted to input two numbers. Before and after the swap, both numbers are displayed on the screen so the difference can be observed.
The swapping process is done using a temporary variable that holds one value while the exchange takes place. This is one of the most common techniques used to swap variables in programming.

Key features:

Uses the Scanner class to read user input.

Displays the numbers before and after swapping.

Demonstrates the use of a temporary variable for value exchange.
This is a fundamental example suitable for beginners learning Java basics such as input handling, variables, and swapping logic.

# SwapNumber

## Description
`SwapNumber` is a simple Java console program that allows the user to enter two integers and then swaps their values. It demonstrates how to use a temporary variable to exchange data between two variables â€” a common task in programming logic and algorithms.

## Features
- Accepts two integer inputs from the user.  
- Displays the values before and after the swap.  
- Implements swapping using a temporary variable.  
- A beginner-friendly example for understanding basic Java concepts.

## Example Output
First Number : 10
Second Number : 25
Before being replaced...
First Number : 10 Second Number : 25
After being replaced...
First Number : 25 Second Number : 10


## How It Works
1. The program uses a `Scanner` object to read two integers from the user.  
2. The value of the first number is stored temporarily in a third variable.  
3. The first number takes the value of the second, and the second takes the value from the temporary variable.  
4. Finally, the program prints the updated values to the console.

## Requirements
- Java JDK 8 or higher  
- A terminal or IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)
